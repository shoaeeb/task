Task-1
Why spend money on a fortune teller when you can create your own destiny? Write a JavaScript function called tellFortune with the following specifications:

i)It should take four arguments: the number of children you'll have, the name of your future partner, the place you'll live in, and your future job title.
ii)The function should display your fortune on the screen in the following format: "You will be a [job title] in [location], and married to [partner's name] with [number of children] kids."
To complete the task, call the tellFortune function three times, each time with different values for the arguments to see different fortune predictions.

Task-2
"The Pet Age Calculator"

Ever wondered how old your cat is in human years? Let's calculate it!

Create a JavaScript function called calculatePetAge with the following specifications:

i) It should take one argument: your pet's age.
ii) Calculate your pet's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 pet years (for example, for a cat).
iii) Display the result on the screen in the format: "Your kitty is NN years old in cat years!"
To make it more interesting, let's consider a bonus feature:

Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that allows you to specify the conversion rate of human years to pet years, accommodating different types of animals.

Now, call the calculatePetAge function three times with various pet ages and conversion rates to see the pet's age in different contexts.
